# Netflix Data Analysis using SQL

This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Netflix movies and shows dataset using **MySQL**. The goal is to gain valuable insights into Netflix's content library by formulating complex SQL queries, which are then used to inform the creation of a dynamic dashboard in **Tableau**.

## Project Objective

The primary objectives of this project were to:
* Understand the content landscape of Netflix's movie and series library.
* Formulate and execute **complex SQL queries** involving multiple joins, aggregations, and conditional statements.
* Explore key aspects of the data, such as common genres, most frequent actors and directors, and popular titles.
* Create a **dynamic dashboard** in Tableau to visualize the insights and allow for interactive exploration.

## Key Questions and Insights

The SQL queries in this project were designed to answer a series of business questions. Here are a few examples of the insights gained:

* **Top and Bottom Rated Content**: Queries were used to identify the top 10 movies and shows based on IMDB score, as well as the bottom 10.
* **Content Trends Over Time**: Analysis of content count per decade revealed trends in Netflix's library expansion.
* **Average Ratings**: The project calculated average IMDB and TMDB scores for movies and shows, as well as for each age certification and production country.
* **Most Common Genres**: The analysis identified the most common genres for both movies and shows, providing insights into viewer preferences and content distribution.
* **Top Talent**: Queries were used to find the top 20 actors and directors with the most appearances or credits.
